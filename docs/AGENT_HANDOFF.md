# Agent Handoff

This repository follows the AcornOps vendor-neutral handoff policy.

## Before Handoff

Run targeted tests while iterating and `npm run validate` before handing off
management-console changes. The default validation gate intentionally excludes
the repeated browser suites.

Do not run `npm run validate:full` for routine UI changes. Run it only when the
work is PR- or release-ready, changes broad or high-risk UI behavior, changes
the browser test harness, updates many visual baselines, or the user explicitly
requests the full gate. For a localized visual change, run only the affected
Playwright spec or design route and record the scope in the handoff.

Use control-plane mode when the change touches real API contracts or mappings.

## Required Evidence

Every handoff must include:

- exact commands run
- pass or fail result for each command
- skipped checks and why they were skipped
- docs changed, or `Docs impact: none` with the reason
- residual risks or follow-up work
- commit hash, branch, or pull request link when applicable

## Commit Message Guidance

Use Conventional Commits 1.0.0 for commits and pull request titles:

```text
type(scope): summary
```

Recommended default types are `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`,
`chore`, `ci`, `build`, `perf`, `style`, and `revert`.

Use `!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer for breaking changes.

Repository teams may document additional types when needed. Existing historical
commits are not rewritten, but new commits and pull request titles must follow
this convention.
This guidance is a repository handoff standard, not a GitHub CI gate.

## Vendor Neutrality

`AGENTS.md` is the repository-tracked agent entrypoint. Do not add required
vendor-specific instruction files such as `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules`, or
`GEMINI.md` as part of this repository's harness.
